Entrance: When the 50 period simple moving average (SMA) crosses over the 100 period SMA, go long when the market opens. 
The crossover suggests that the trend has recently turned up.

Exit: Exit long and go short the next day when 100 period SMA crosses over 50 period SMA. The crossover suggests that the trend has turned down.
Stop loss: Set a stop loss based on maximum loss acceptable. 

STOPLOSS: 
For example, if the recent, say 10-day, average true range is 0.5% of current market price, stop loss could be set at 4x0.5% = 2%.
Conventional wisdom on stop losses set the risk per trade anywhere between 1%-5% of capital for a single trade; this risk varies from one trader to another.
